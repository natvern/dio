\section{Related Work}

As discussed previously in Section \ref{symrl}, neurosymbolic AI trends show promising results in improving ML algorithms, whether that is from 
an interpretability aspect or an optimization one. More recent works take this trend and incorporate symbolic reasoning and 
domain knowledge in reinforcement learning settings \cite{Driessens2010,Romero2020,achiam2017,marek2010}. \cite{marek2010,Romero2020} use the general idea of \textit{reward shaping} and \textit{epsilon adaptation} respectively 
to incorporate procedural knowledge into a RL algorithm. Both introduce this combination as a successful strategy to guide the exploration and exploitation tradeoff in RL. They both show promising results. While 
\cite{marek2010} focuses on providing formal specifications for reward shaping, it lacks practical 
consequences to the implementation of most RL to make use of its formal methods conclusions. On the other hand, \cite{Romero2020} proposes a method to adapt $\epsilon$ based on domain knowledge, the method is specifically applied to "Welding Sequence Optimization".  
To do so, the RL algorithm is modified in itself, similarly to what was done in \cite{Driessens2010}. Precisely, in \cite{Driessens2010}, the RL algorithm itself is 
modified to deal with states that are model-based as opposed to vectors. They defined their method as Relational RL. 
Furthermore, they conclude that by using more expressive representation language for the RL scenario, their method can be potentially offer a solution to the problem of meta-learning. 
While \cite{Romero2020,Driessens2010} both present promising rewards, they lack the modularity necessary for scaling the proposed methods to further RL implementations. Those by taking their results into consideration, 
we are hopeful that symbolic reasoning and RL integration could provide a solution for reward shaping, meta-learning and the exploration-exploitation dilemma.

Current Neurosymbolic AI trends are concerned with knowledge representation and reasoning, namely, they investigate computational-logic systems 
and representation to precede learning in order to provide some form
of incremental update, e.g. a meta-network to group two sub-neural
networks~\cite{Besold2017NeuralSymbolicLA}.
As a result, neurosymbolic AI has been successfully applied to vision-based tasks such as semantic labeling \cite{vinyals2015, karpathy2015}, 
vision analogy-making \cite{Reed2015DeepVA}, or learning communication
protocols \cite{Foerster2016LearningTC}.
Those results inspire us to use those techniques\giselle{Which
techniques?} for reinforcement learning, as to tackle its challenges.\samar{Need to connect this to previous paragraph.}
